        This property indicates the number of in-use slots of available slots
        for alarms. The typical example is something like this: the hardware
        register is 32 bits wide, but only 3 of the bits have a physical
        counterpart. The driver is generally written so that all 32 bits can
        be used, but the IP block is reused in a lot of designs, some using
        all 32 bits, some using 3 and some using 12. In this case, setting
        "nalarms = <3>;" informs the driver that only the first 3 alarms, at
        local offset 0 .. 2, are in use.  For cases in which there might be
        holes in the slot range, this value should be the max slot number+1.
